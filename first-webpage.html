    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Umair. I am currently studying software development through <strong>TheOdinProject</strong>. My ambitions are to learn first learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript and continue to learn to expand my knowledege of the coding world. I believe it is an extremely useful skill in our current world as it is heavily technology based. As I embark on the journey to get that first software development job, I have started a 100 days of coding challenge on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6a1tObfjlGGlZDp4t0A82A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube channel</a> where I upload daily videos summarising the work I have done.</p>
    
    <p>It will be interesting for me to see the progress from <a href="https://youtu.be/yZxQijuFbBo?si=XC9nrnFHSjRAkOrx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Day 1</a> to when I finish! <strong>(Ofcourse the learning does not stop there lol)</strong></p>
    
    <h3>What are my current goals?</h3>
    <p>I am currently working on becoming a software developer. This ambition of mine came from wondering what career I could dedicate myself to, a path that would correlate with the amount of effort that I would put in.</p>
